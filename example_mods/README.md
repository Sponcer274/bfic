## **GUIDE:**
You will start on a stage Name selection Menu **![Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972227942971236392/986589194694570024/unknown.png)**

You must select a name for your stage first

If the stage Name was ```nil``` Aka ('', empty) Then the stage name will turn into 'stage1',

After selecting a Stage Name Hit Enter.

You'll Be Directed To The Stage Editor

![Main-Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972227942971236392/986590567733542962/unknown.png)

You will See a text That Contains info About The Character Positions and movement speed, camera zoom, etc...

And **Three Buttons With An Arrow On It**,

These Buttons open a **list of Buttons** that can be clicked on

![Main-Button](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/972227942971236392/986591445962088468/unknown.png?width=920&height=498)

Let's Take the **Main List** As an example

It opens a list of common stuff on a regular stage
[Add Sprite], [Add **Animated** Sprite], [Add Animation], [Remove Sprite].

Clicking on AddSprite OR add Animated Sprite will redirect you to this section

![AddSprite](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972227942971236392/986592853893459978/unknown.png)

All you gotta do Is Type Your sprite's Name and Tag and choose a camera

The Stage Editor Then will make your wanted sprite

The Stage Editor Will give you A warning if the Sprite **doesn't Have a _Tag_ or an _Image_** and if the Sprite **doesn't Exist in the _PATHS_**

I Will now Make An Example Sprite Called *suzy* with the camera (other)
